## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

The kayakers guide to the French Alps provides a brief overview of paddleable rivers, places to visit, and stay within the area. The website displays information for a user to plan their kayaking holiday accordingly and connect with other like minded paddlers.

The sign up page provides a way for the user to register to an online paddling community where they can share experiences. Albeit just a concept page for the purpose of this website, the paddling community is an online social media site that allows users to access more information and connect with other users to share stories and advice.

#### Key Information for the site

- Featured rivers that are accessible to paddlers of most abilities.
- An example of places to visit, stay at, and experience within the area. External links are also provided here with more information on where to look and book.
- A sign up form allowing people to register and connect with others, followed by a thank you page when the user inputs their details.

### User Stories

#### Client Goals

- To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
- To provide easy to understand, and accessible information for people planning a kayaking holiday.
- To provide a means to a platform where the paddling community can connect and grow.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- I want to know where to start when planning my first paddling holiday.
- I want to be greeted with visually exciting imagery that appeals to the adventurous paddler and explorer.
- I want to be able to navigate through the website with ease and find the information I require quickly.
- I want to be able to easily navigate to external links provided that will give me further detailed information on how to plan my holiday.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

- I want to be able to sign up to the online paddling community to connect with others and share potential holiday adventures of my own.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

- I want to see regular updates to potential new places to paddle, places to visit, and things to do.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Matching gradient from ColorSpace](docs/images/matching-gradient.png)

The website uses this matching gradient scheme, pulled from [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23000000&sub=1), and generated from #000 (black). I chose this option, as it has similarities to alpine blue rivers, which ties in with the theme of the website. Providing this consistency across all 4 pages, contributes to a positive user experience.

### Typography

I used Google Fonts for the following fonts:

- Roboto Condensed for all headings, and subheadings across the site. This is a sans-serif font.
- Roboto for the body text across the site. This is a sans-serif font.
- Shadow into Light for the ‘Paddle Adventures’ logo font. This is a cursive font.

### Imagery

All digital images, (excluding two images in the [credit](#media) section), were taken by myself. I converted these from jpeg to webp using [BIRME](https://www.birme.net/).
The logo image featuring a paddle outline, was created by myself using the ‘Paintbrush’ application on my laptop.
